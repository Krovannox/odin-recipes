        <h3>A Japanese-style fried chicken</h3>

        <p>Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This is my family recipe and can also be used 
            to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of chicken. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu 
            sauce.</p>

            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>

            <li>Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes.</li>
            <li>Coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg, and then press
